## Hat Tips

- **simple-hooks** is based on the excellent Udemy course instruction by [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/StephenGrider). 
Stephen's course [Modern React with Redux - [2019 Update]](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/content) now 
includes a helpful primer on React hooks: [Section 25: Hooks with Functional Components](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview).

- **simple-hooks** was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
